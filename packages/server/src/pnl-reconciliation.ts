/**
 * TRA-1633 FIX 3 — cross-surface P&L reconciliation guard.
 *
 * The board asked that the four daily-P&L surfaces (trade journal / PnL tracker /
 * EOD report / Calendar) agree. Three of them differ BY DESIGN in which legs
 * they cover — this note documents that so an operator reading a mismatch knows
 * it is definitional, not a bug:
 *
 *  - PnL tracker `dailyPnl`         → STOCK-only realized (paper-account marks)
 *  - Trade journal / Desk calendar  → OPTIONS-only realized (firm-wide journal)
 *  - EOD report / account calendar  → STOCK + OPTIONS realized (the daily cell)
 *
 * All four are realized-only and bucket on the US/Eastern day boundary. The one
 * identity that MUST hold on every day is therefore:
 *
 *     EOD.combinedPnl  ==  stock dailyPnl (realized)  +  day-only options realized
 *
 * `reconcilePnl` checks that identity per ET day and flags any |drift| over the
 * penny tolerance. Pure + I/O-free so it is unit-testable; the caller supplies
 * the persisted daily snapshots and a date→EOD-combinedPnl map read off disk.
